# Neule.art

Neule.art is a small tool for visualising colors for Riddari Icelandic sweater. It's built with Eleventy.

## Contributing

If you find a bug, [report it as an issue](https://github.com/eevajonnapanula/neule.art/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+). Or if you have an idea of a feature, [send a feature request](https://github.com/eevajonnapanula/neule.art/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

I'm not actively looking for contributors right now, so even if you create a pull request, I might not notice it/have time to review it. I'm sorry about that. 


## Planned features

Here are couple of ideas, how I might improve the site:
- [ ] Show random colors
- [ ] Add possibility to share the colors in cleaner format (png?)
- [ ] Show stock from some yarn stores
