# Neule.art

Neule.art is a small tool for visualising colors for Riddari Icelandic sweater. It's built with Eleventy.
![View from Neule.art's front page showing a drawn Riddari-sweater in the following colors: black, lagoon, apricot and heaven blue. Next to the shirt there are select-fields for each color, and under them a button with text "Check the result."](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28345294/168206375-61d14250-f4dd-46c2-8475-37ae3ab51e1e.png)

## Contributing

If you find a bug, [report it as an issue](https://github.com/eevajonnapanula/neule.art/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+). Or if you have an idea of a feature, [send a feature request](https://github.com/eevajonnapanula/neule.art/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).

I'm not actively looking for contributors right now, so even if you create a pull request, I might not notice it/have time to review it. I'm sorry about that. 


## Planned features

Here are couple of ideas, how I might improve the site:
- [x] Show random colors
- [x] Show stock from some yarn stores
- [x] Add possibility to choose color for every motif for Riddari
- [ ] Progressive enhancement: Change color dynamically
- [ ] New patterns and yarns
