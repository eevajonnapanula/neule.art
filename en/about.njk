<h1>About the site</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
  I was knitting a <a href="https://lopidesign.is/en/shop/adults/sweaters/riddari/">Riddari-sweater</a> for someone as a
  present, and I needed to get the information about the yarn colors for the sweater. It can be really hard to imagine,
  what the finished sweater would look like, if you've never knitted one (and even if you have, it still is), so I
  needed some way to visualise the possible color choices.
</p>

<p>
  The colors on the selects are from Istex' site - the colors they have for LÃ©ttlopi-yarn. You can find the codes of
  each color from the select-fields as well. Also, the colors you can see in the picture are only examples, I tried to
  get them close to the actual colors. However, I will not take any responsibility of the finished garment ðŸ˜„
